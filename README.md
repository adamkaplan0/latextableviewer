# LaTeX Table Viewer

## Background

Out of personal frustration of visualizing complicated LaTeX tables generated by code, and a passion for web development, LaTeX Table Viewer came to life! This project is my first-ever React application and I also got to play around with WASM in the makings of this. It is far from done and is being actively developed.

## Instructions

### Usage

Simply copy and paste your LaTeX table code into the code editor and compile your table. All compilation happens on your computer, no data/information is collected. If you need additional packages, view the full source code and add it where appropriate.

### Deploying

To deploy this on your own, you just need to install all the dependencies with `npm install` and can then run it using `npm run start` or build it with `npm run build`.

Although all the compilation happens locally using a WASM binary, due to the nature of LaTeX, it requires running a server to fetch all the necessary LaTeX files. Thanks to the amazing work of the [SwiftLaTeX](https://github.com/SwiftLaTeX/SwiftLaTeX) team, there is a simple [Docker container](https://github.com/SwiftLaTeX/Texlive-Ondemand) available to host your own server. I slightly modified it to make it compatible with modern Docker container deployments. You can download my fork [here](https://github.com/adamkaplan0/latextableviewer-endpoint). The publicly accessible [LaTeX Table Viewer](https://www.latextableviewer.com/) uses a server hosted by me, reachable at `endpoint.latextableviewer.com`. Please host your own endpoint and change the `texlive_endpoint` URL in the `swiftlatexdvipdfm.js` and `swiftlatexxetex.js` files.

To compile the engine from scratch, check out [SwiftLaTeX's](https://github.com/SwiftLaTeX/SwiftLaTeX) tutorial. There are some small tweaks you need to do to get it to work nicely with webpack and web workers. You can see the tweaks in my [fork](https://github.com/adamkaplan0/swiftlatex-engine/tree/web_worker_compatible). I am working on a PR to merge it with the SwiftLaTeX project.

## Credits

This project is powered by [SwiftLaTeX](https://github.com/SwiftLaTeX/SwiftLaTeX) and their efforts of creating a Web Assembly binary for TeXLive. I tweaked their code slightly to make it work nice with Webpack and it is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adamkaplan0/swiftlatex-engine/tree/web_worker_compatible) alongside this application.
